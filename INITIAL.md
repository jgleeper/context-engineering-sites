## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

[Common Issues
    AESM vs CommonJS conflicts
‚Üí Forgot export default in tailwind.config.js led to build errors.

Incorrect component boundaries
‚Üí React hooks in server components without "use client" threw runtime errors.

Favicon not updating
‚Üí Cursor/Vercel cached old favicon.ico even after replacement.

Form field mismatch
‚Üí Frontend fields didn‚Äôt align with backend expectations ‚Äî caused silent 500s.

Unused imports or types
‚Üí Cursor sometimes left unused variables after regen, causing TypeScript errors.

Port conflicts not reported clearly
‚Üí Auto-switched from 3000 to 3001 without clear logging ‚Äî caused confusion.

Resend setup not fully scaffolded
‚Üí Cursor didn‚Äôt prompt for fallback domain or clarify Gmail app password flow.

Scroll behavior issues
‚Üí Anchor links sometimes missed IDs or scroll-behavior: smooth wasn‚Äôt set globally.

InView animations glitching
‚Üí Cursor used useInView without debounce or margin adjustments ‚Äî caused disappearing elements.

Cookie modals overlapping content
‚Üí No layout shift planning ‚Äî modals overlapped CTAs/content on mobile.
Multiple package-lock.json files
‚Üí Nested lockfiles caused dependency resolution issues and random build failures.

Wrong splash screen logic
‚Üí Cursor would render splash animations without gating main content ‚Äî led to flash-of-unstyled-content (FOUC).

Globals.css misplacement
‚Üí Cursor sometimes injected Tailwind directives into the wrong file or duplicated them.

Static asset path errors
‚Üí Cursor misreferenced image paths like /images/hero.png instead of /public/images/hero.png.

No vercel.json suggestion
‚Üí Never prompted to include vercel.json for rewrites or edge functions ‚Äî broke routing in some cases.

Client-side only utilities in shared modules
‚Üí Code with window, localStorage, or document got copied into shared utils ‚Üí broke SSR.

Animation overkill by default
‚Üí Cursor overused Framer Motion for everything ‚Äî bloated bundle size and caused layout jitter.

Scroll-triggered animations without cleanup
‚Üí useEffect or scroll listeners leaked without teardown ‚Äî caused memory spikes on long pages.

Z-index stacking issues
‚Üí Cursor stacked elements without z-index planning ‚Üí modals hidden behind navs or hero overlays.

Meta tags missing or incomplete
‚Üí Didn‚Äôt auto-generate og:image, og:title, or twitter:card ‚Äî led to poor link previews.
